Hi everyone, just a heads up about the repo. There are three folders in there:

- "GWCT"
- "TravelMaster-old-pls-disregard"
- "travel-master-main"

The final project with the most accurate and updated source code is in the **"travel-master-main"** folder. Please **always** refer to this folder and **disregard** the other two folders (**_GWCT_** and **_TravelMaster-old-pls-disregard_)**. 

Due to the owner's unfamiliarity with Git, this is the easiest way they could come up with to organize the files. Apologies for the messy setup.
